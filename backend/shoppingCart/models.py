from django.db import models

# These are the configurations of our database tables. Each class below corresponds
# to one table.

# We just do the configuration here, all the data are stored in MySQL server.

# All the tables are in the database with the name "saved_courses_db". You should have
# created this database using MySQL shell commands.

# Go to setting.py to see the connection setting between Django and MySQL server.

# Think each field as the columns of the table. We need to add all the columns here

# Each time you change the models, you need to do migrations:
#   1. python manage.py makemigrations # add the migrations files in migrations
#                                        folder. This file will contain the instructions
#                                        do update database schema 
#   2. python manage.py migrate        # apply the changes

# Each model will automatically have a field id for primary key. It uniquely identifies a 
# row.
