# Name: Shuyi Wan (Sherry)

# About Me:
I am a senior-year student. I got project experience from CS156 including basic Java/JavaScript and website development. In my free time, I like playing video games and hiking.

# Ideas:
* Apply a recommendation system.
* Build a website that users can interact with (input, edit, etc).
* Have some UI design.
* Develop a school-related tool (course content) and help users dig into broader content outside of school.
