## Assessment of Existing Strengths
- Kevin: Python backend and SQL databases (Flask), REST APIs, pure JavaScript.
- Claire: Lots of design experience, UI/UX and web development courses (HTML, CSS, Javascript).
- Shuyi: React (Java & Javascript) experience from CS156.
- Yicong: React experience, Javascript.
- Katz Yan: Some experience with Python Flask.
- Mariana: Experience with React, Java, Javascript, API implementation, C++, and Python.
- Leo: React (Java & Javascript) experience from CS156, some experience with SQL & HTML.
- Ivan: Worked in previous courses using React and API for frontend and backend, also used Java/JavaScript, Python, and C++.

## Interests
- Kevin:
- Claire: Front-end, React.
- Shuyi:
- Yicong: React and Django.
- Katz Yan:
- Mariana:
- Ivan:
- Leo: Back-end, Django, React, API.

## Existing Weaknesses
- Kevin: Very little experience with React.
- Claire: Hasn’t used React or done much back-end development, planning to watch tutorials.
- Shuyi: No experience in backend databases.
- Yicong: No experience with backend and Django.
- Katz Yan: Little experience in any frontend frameworks and backend databases (but willing to learn).
- Mariana: Not much experience in backend and frontend development, still learning about Django & advanced React.
- Ivan: Still learning front-end and back-end, recently introduced to this work last quarter.
- Leo: Few experiences with React, very few backend development experience.

## Buddy Pairings

## Learning Plan
- Kevin: Learn to understand and write React, learn Django to replace Flask functionality. Will read Django documentation this week. React documentation readings will come as the team starts to get the codebase set up.
- Claire: Watch tutorials this week on React and back-end development. Research similar products for inspiration. Prepare for Friday’s retro by making a worksheet for prototyping ideas.
- Yicong: Learn more Django in the next two weeks. Week 3: Find videos to watch. Week 4: Practice with the documentation.
- Shuyi: Learn more React for the rest of this week by checking the tutorial website and videos. Start to learn Django next week (Week 4).
- Katz: Started learning Django by following YouTube tutorials. Also planning to watch videos about databases.
- Ivan: Self-study more about Django, not fully familiar with the language. Review previous work in Frontend and Backend from other courses.
- Mariana: Self-study and watch tutorials to get a better understanding of how React and Django work. Review concepts and ideas from previous courses.

## Gaps in Knowledge
- At an individual level, address knowledge gaps by creating strategic buddy pairings.
- Ensure everyone has the baseline skills necessary to succeed in implementing the idea.
- For the group as a whole, there is a lot to learn, especially with back-end development.
- Still trying to make plans concrete as far as functionality/design.
- Working together to create the MVP.
- Especially need to review Django to set up subdirectories and begin developing the web application.
