**Absent:** None  
**Link to Retro:** [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qN7JC6MhrQkJSEaJWVPjjmvtNMf5LgUE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113612488218708803843&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Action Item

**Goal:**  
The team decided that we collectecly want to stop making huge pull request that add multiple functions to avoid mergin conflicts and making it easier to follow through the reviews.

**Commitment:**  
Some of the commitments our team has proposed are the following:
* We will communicate frequently to ask for help from each other and prevent technical or merge conflicts
* We will polish the product as much as we can before the final launch
* Complete our assigned issues to implement the features we want in the web app
* We will do more frequent PR and Code Review


**Measurement:**  
For the measurement, we can find our commitments were successful if our final product is ready by the code-freeze.

**Optional:**  
We have interest in implementing some extra features to the frontend of our web application, so we will be working on those if time allows it.


## Retro Assessment

For this Retro assessment, I decided to use a similar approach as the one used in the previous retro. Thus, we used Google Docs to gather information as it is an easy approach where everyone can collaborate and add their ideas at the same time. In this case, we used the approach used in our previous retros: *Start/Stop/Continue*.

In my opinion, I think that the retro went well. We all were able to discuss what we think is going well in the team, what we shoul dtry and implement, and what is not working in our team. Everyone was engaged and brought up good points regarding aspects that we should start, stop, and/or continue doing for the remainning time we have as a team. It also gave us insight on how our performance is and how we want to improve. I believe it was a good time to talk to our team members!

Based on what I was able to see in this retro, I would recommend the next leader to have some kind of aid -- such as a google doc -- to gather important information and key point ideas that the team members bring up. I also would recommend to have some questions ready to help guide the conversation. In addition, since this is a time to listen to your peers and see how everyone is doing and what they think of the performance of the team, having your answers ready can be helpful as it gives an idea of how to guide the conversation. And last but not least, make sure to let everyone participate and get engaged in such important conversation; if everyone participates, the insight you will get i sway better! Remember, this is a time for everyone to voice their concerns and what they like about the team and the work everyone is doing.


## Change

The one Stop we had in Start/Stop/Continue was 'stop making a huge pull request that add multiple functions'. We all agreed that it's important for everyone to keep making small changes to make sure the product is working correctly.

As we approach the final stretch of the quarter and get closer to the final deadline, we agreed that this is important to make sure our final product works correctly and as expected. We also believe that this will help us avoid any merging conflicts that could delay our production.
