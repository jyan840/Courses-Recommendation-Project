**Led by:** Ivan Hernandez  
**Present:** Claire, Mariana, Shuyi, Yicong, Kevin, Katz, Leo (Everyone)  
**Absent:** None  
**Link to Retro:** [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tMJzWnq6wuePpH52CdjIjZotGaTkdnr0/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115179698073021643197&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Action Item

**Goal:**  
The team decided that we collectecly want to stop approving pull requests before reviewing code so that we have fewer bugs.

**Change/experiment:**  
An experiment we will do is review code before approving pull requests, we expect to see fewer merge conflicts and bugs.

**Measurement:**  
For the measurement, we can find our experiment was successful if we spent less time resolving merge conflicts.

**Optional:**  
We have interest in learning more about frontend and backend, so we have decided to spend time outside of class.

## Retro Assessment

For this retro assessment, we used google docs as it was an easy approach to having everyone collaborate at the same time. Additionally, we used the Start/Stop/Continue approach.

Overall, I think it went well, and we were able to discuss different ideas and come up with an action plan. Everyone in the group had a good time thinking of what we should start, stop, and continue based on our current performance. 

Additionally, there were some good converastion among the members of the group on what we are doing well, and how we should keep moving forward. 

Based on what we learned, I would recommend the next retro leader prepares guiding questions in addition to the retro template. Because this is a time for you to listen, think about your answers to the template questions in advance and then develop leading questions that could be used to guide the conversation if it becomes stagnant. Also, maybe do some background research to gain an understanding of some of the technical skills required by certain tasks your teammates are completing. We all have different skill sets and experience levels, but as a leader, it’s important to have a broad understanding of the technical aspects of the individual components of a product, since you are responsible for those components successfully integrating together.

## Change

The one Stop we had in Start/Stop/Continue was 'Assigning issues to people that require other issues to be completed, causing a lack of progress'. We all agreed that it's important for everyone to always have something to work on at all times and ask for support when needed.

We implemented this change since last week, and I think it has made our team function better. We’ve been able to have more discussions surrounding the issues and how we need to work together to make each component work. 

We are going to keep this change. We also talked about doing code reviews earlier, and this change helps us accomplish this goal. In addition, we wanted to make sure that we have a weekly to-do list and that we can customize it as needed to ensure all the tasks get finished in time. This is something that goes hand-in-hand with our change, and overall, we are a lot more organized and clear on roles and responsibilities since we’ve started assigning issues early in the week.

## Experiment and Outcome

Experiment: review code before approving pull requests, we expect to see fewer merge conflicts and bugs.

Measurement: if we spent less time resolving merge conflicts, then we were sucessful at our experiment.

Outcome: The outcome of this experiement has been sucessful thus far. We have been doing a better job at reviewing code before approving the pull requests, which has lowered the merge conflicts and bugs.
