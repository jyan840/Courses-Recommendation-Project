# Name: Kevin Nguyen
# About Me: 
I enjoy working on a Chess engine in C++ in my free time, but I also enjoy tinkering about with other languages and different types of projects.

# Ideas:
* Goals for completing recommended tasks
* History for recommended tasks
* Some statistics and graphics where one can enter grades after a course completes to get a post mortem
