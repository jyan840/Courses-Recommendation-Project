# Scribed Discussion:

## Standup:

- **Mariana:** Look into the other API, still working with Ivan. Also figured out what was wrong with the database… should be up and running
- **Kevin:** Looking into places we could host our project. AWS, Python anywhere, backend pull request needs to get reviewed
- **Shuyi:** Finished the login page and file organization. Working on the search page but needs to wait for backend to be set up. Needs to do basic layout stuff of the front-end
- **Katz:** Wrapping up the last issues, API for search should be finished. Still trying to figure out how React can connect to the backend
- **Yicong:** Front-end is pretty much done, not much to do right now
- **Claire:** Made minor adjustments to the shopping cart, also fixed the continue shopping button, worked on a bunch of logo options
- **Leo:** Finished the front-end documentation and will make a PR very soon
- **Ivan:** Absent (sick) but working with Mariana on API and database issues

## Tasks Performed:

Completed most issues from last week
Determined what still needs to be done before our MVP presentation:

1. We have not built back-end for the shopping cart (can be finished after MVP, we just won’t be able to save the data yet)
2. Figure out how we’re going to deploy the front-end (Heroku? Reander? Firebase? AWS?)
3. Make sure we have the documentation for the back-end

Discussed plan of action moving forward

## Plans for Today:

Continue working on MVP
