# Name: Mariana Rosillo
## About me: 
I'm a third-year CS major. During my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, walking on the beach, and listening to music!

## Ideas:
* Use React to build our web application/website.
* For the backend, we maybe can use ```spring-boot```.
* Heroku or a similar thing to "dokku" could be use for our product.
* We need to consider which is the best datbase we could use to store our data.
* For signing in/up, I would suggest to use Google OAuth.

Note: these ideas are to be discussed with my team to see if these are viable and could be implemented to our project.
