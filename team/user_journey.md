# General Idea:
As an incoming student at UCSB, it's very hard to access counseling support in a fast and efficient manner. Hence, many students often end up taking classes that ultimately they don’t need. They also might have prerequisites that they did not need to take before signing up for the class. With our web application, students would have a suggested section in their class search page, where based on your courses, it will tell you suggested and commonly registered courses that students should consider taking. The idea is that students have reliable sources of information that provide courses that are useful towards their major and have been popular among students from their same major. 

Once the courses start, we can upload class documents and parse important information to generate summaries and recommendations for future readings and practice. 

<ol>
  <li>As a student, it’s hard to find a list of study materials - Our product will streamline the search for useful classes.</li>
  <li>As a last-minute student, it’ll be helpful to have a summarized platform available. </li>
  <li>For students trying to get a head start, our system will allow them to have an understanding of what courses they will need to take in the future.</li>
  <li>Perhaps consider adding different levels of user experience depending on how much information the student needs regarding the class. </li>
