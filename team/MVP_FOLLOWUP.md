# Team 04 - Platinum Feedback Summary

## Feedback Summary:

The feedback varied across students, however, here is a summary of comments provided to our project. 

Most individuals asked how Platinum differs from Gold, the reactions were positive and they liked the UI, however, they did not see a major difference between Gold and Platinum, specifically since the shopping cart has already been implemented to Gold. Another individual mentioned that the key search is not fully accurate, as CS 130A did not show up when the word “Algorithm” was entered. We were suggested to add a word vector/embedding search over course descriptions which may bring in new courses that people may not be aware exist in other disciplines. For instance, e.g. searching machine learning might bring up linear algebra. In addition, part of our feedback encouraged us to add features to Platinum that GOLD does not have, such as constructing possible course paths based on graduation requirements and eventually, being able to include class sizes/course enrollment history, on top of having an AI advisor (counselor) who creates different schedule possibilities and compare course load which is a feature that Gold does not offer. 


## Response Summary:
- Difference from Gold: The key difference from Gold is searching by keyword so far, we need to implement more features. Compared with Gold, Platinum is more like a personal study plan website not for course registration of GOLD. 
- Search feature: Currently, searching is based on keywords appearing in the description of courses. If certain keywords don't appear in the course description, the course more likely doesn’t cover the content of keywords. But this is a good point that we should consider the title of the courses, and it would be ideal if we could improve searching so it pops up related courses based on certain keywords also.

## Next Steps:
- Improve searching: the title of the courses could also be considered when searching by keywords. And ideally, the web can generate relative courses based on given keywords. Professor ratings and grade distributions can also be added to the search results.
- Implement a shopping cart: users can edit their course plan, and we could also consider applying a YouTube API to recommend videos based on course topics.
- Integrate with AI: AI could be applied to generate relative topics when searching by keywords. It also can be used in video recommendations.
