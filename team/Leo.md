# Ideas
- Design a good user interface with suitable icons and background theme color/picture.
- Build controllers or endpoints that allow users to add courses, names, emails, subjects/topics, modify inputted information, and delete inputted information.
- Store user input and admins can see the data stored.
- Incorporate a recommendation-searching service that can search for recommended learning materials based on our analysis of user input. Then provide the user with links, PDFs, etc.
- Provide a summary of topics that users may need based on the content of their courses.
