## Name: Katz(Jin) Yan



#### About Me:

I am a junior computer science major student. I have not taken 156 but I have some experience using Python Flask. I took 190I last quarter so I have some basic knowledge about deep learning as well. 

#### Ideas For Project:

1. Besides providing the recommended topics, we can also provide the level of difficulty of those topics as well as the recommended learning sequence(e.g list them from the easiest ones to the hardest ones)
2. Instead of generating a bunch of topics on the scope of the entire courses, we can allow the users to type in their interests or their weak spots(e.g which parts they don't understand), and then provide some resources focusing on their interests or weaknesses.
