## About me: 
Hello everyone - I'm a third-year CS major! I am interested in the areas of Software Engineering, Product Management and Entrepenurship. During my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, watching movies/series, and listening to music. 

## Ideas:
* Use React to build our web application/website.
* For the backend, we can use ```spring-boot```.
* Heroku or a similar server to "dokku" could be use for our product.
* We need to consider which is the best database we could use to store our data.
* For signing in/up, I would suggest to use Google OAuth.

Note: these ideas are to be discussed with my team to see if these are viable and could be implemented to our project.
