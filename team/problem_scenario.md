## Problem Scenario
- A student logs onto Canvas to study for an upcoming final. A user comes across a billion documents and runs those documents into an automatic parser to find what’s important.
- A student doesn’t know what upper-division courses to take next, so they enter their previous course history to gain a recommended selection of courses.
- A tutor has a student and wants to know exactly what the student is covering in class, so the tutor enters the student’s course information to get a summary.
- A student enters the syllabus and course content of the upcoming course, and they can find which previous courses they took is useful, and they can also get a preview of the upcoming course.
- A student is writing an essay for a course, so they upload a class document and get recommended related articles.
- A student wants to know how two different professors teach the same course, so the student requests course summaries for both instances of the course.
