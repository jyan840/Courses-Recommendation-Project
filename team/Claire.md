## About me:

Hi, i'm a third-year CS major. I have some (limited) project experience from my game development internship this past summer. I really love art and design, and during my free time I try to spend time with friends or do activities like yoga, sewing, and listening to music.

## Ideas:

- Use React to build our web application/website
- Potentially provide a seamless experience for users by importing course details directly from their university accounts
- Develop a system for automatically tagging and organizing notes based on content analysis
- Implement natural language processing (NLP) to extract key concepts and create relevant tags for better categorization (??)
- Incorporate social elements such as discussion forums or study groups for each course
- Introduce gamification elements to make studying more engaging

**Note:** These ideas are to be discussed with my team to see if these are viable and could be implemented in our project.
